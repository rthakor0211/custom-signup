1. Copy and install WordPress setup.
2. I have used the "WP Mail SMTP" plugin for SMTP configuration and sending OTP emails.
3. Configure the SMTP setting before testing it.
4. After configuring SMTP go to the homepage
       => Go to the signup page to register the user
       => After submitting the signup form user will receive one OTP email, the subject name "Email verification OTP."
       => Need to add OTP in verify-email-OTP page
       => After adding OTP user will redirect to the sign-in page
       => After successfully signIn user will redirect to the company name subdomain, e.g. https://company_name.domain.com
