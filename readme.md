- Copy and install wordpress setup.
- I have used "WP Mail SMTP" plugin for SMTP configuration and send OTP email.
- Need to configure SMTP setting before testing it.
- After configure SMTP go to homepage
	- Go to signup page for register user
	- After submit the signup from user will recive one OTP email, subect name "Email verification OTP"
	- Need to add OTP in verify-email-otp page
	- After add OTP user will redirect on signIn page
	- After successfully signIn user will redirect on company name subdomain,  eg. https://company_name.domain.com
