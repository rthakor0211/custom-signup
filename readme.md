- Copy and install WordPress setup.
- I have used the "WP Mail SMTP" plugin for SMTP configuration and sending OTP emails.
- Configure the SMTP setting before testing it.
- After configuring SMTP go to the homepage
	- Go to the signup page to register the user with company name (for sub domain)
	- After submitting the signup form user will receive one OTP email, the subject name "Email verification OTP."
	- Need to add OTP in verify-email-OTP page
	- After adding OTP user will redirect to the sign-in page
	- After successfully signIn user will redirect to the company name subdomain, e.g. https://company_name.domain.com
